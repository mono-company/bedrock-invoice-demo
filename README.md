# Bedrock content template: Monoboot

This is a content template for Bedrock based on Twitter Bootstrap. It is a customized version of Twitter Bootstrap used in Mono projects.

To preview it, make sure you have the bedrock repository on your machine. Clone it from `https://github.com/mono-company/bedrock/`.

## How to use

Use these files as content for a Bedrock install. Simply copy over the files in a Bedrock prototype to start using them.

## How to develop

This repository needs Bedrock to run, but its `.gitignore` file ignores everything that is not the actual content. To start adjusting the content template, a script is provided to easily install Bedrock in this repository provided this repository is in the same parent folder e.g.:

    ├── Sites
        ├── bedrock
        ├── bedrock-template-monoboot

Run `install-bedrock.sh` to copy over the bedrock folder, so you can preview the contents.
